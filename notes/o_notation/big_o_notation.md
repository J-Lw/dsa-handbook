### Big O Notation

- Big O is a notation used to describe the computational complexity of a given algorithm.
- An algorithms computational complexity is comprised of two aspects: time complexity and space complexity.
- Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to finish running with respect to the size of its given input.
- Space complexity is the amount of memory allocated by an algorithm when it is run with respect to the size of its input.
- Time complexity is typically the aspect of an algorithms complexity that concerns programmers the most.
- Time complexity: as the size of input increases, how much longer does the algorithm take to run.
- Space complexity: as the the size of input increases, how much more memory does the algorithm use.

### How Complexity Works
- An algorithms complexity is described as a mathematical function.
- The arguments to the function are variabes defined by the programmer.
- Common arguments includes 'n', which denotes the length of an input array/string.
- Given the fact that n denotes the length of something variable in size, n itself will affect the complexity properties of the algorithm.
- When written, the mathematical function used to describe the algorithm exists in the following forms: 
  - O(n)
  - O(n^2)
  - O(2^n)
  - O(log n)
  - O(n * m)
- These functions represent the complexity of an algorithm.
- Each of the unique function forms can be used to describe time or space complexity.
